## Installing on Windows:

1. Choose some directory for the application to be stored.
    (e.g. ~/my/path/`)

2.  If you have git installed then you can run -
    `git clone https://github.com/Active-Site-Project/3D-Representation.git` -
    from inside the directory that you you would like the project to be
    installed in. If you do not have git installed,you can download the
    repository .zip file and extract it to the directory that you would like
    the project to be stored in.

3.  In order to compile the program, you will need to use the 'make' command, which is
    not included in Windows by default.

4.  To use the makefile in Windows, you will need to install a program called Cygwin.
    For more information about what exact Cygwin is/does, visit their website at https://cygwin.com.

5.  Install Cygwin by running setup-x86_64.exe (64-bit installation) or setup-x86.exe (32-bit installation).
    These files can be acquired from https://cygwin.com/install.html

6.  Choose "Install from Internet" in the "Choose Installation Type" section.

7.  Choose whatever settings you want for the succeeding sections (I recommend the default) until you get to
    the "Select Packages" section. Make sure you remember where your root installation directory is, however, as we
    will need it later.

8.  In the search bar located at the upper-left area of the window, type "make" and press enter. Locate the package
    called "make: the GNU version of the 'make' utility." In the row where you found the package, select the looping
    arrows icon (in the "New" column). You should see message next to the icon change from "Skip" to some version number.

9.  Click "Next" and install make (along with any other automatically included and default packages).

10. Finish the installation. Now you have 'make' functionality on your Windows PC. You still can't quite use the makefile from
    command prompt yet. In order to merge Cygwin's functionality with the command prompt, we need to add the "bin" folder
    from root installation directory of Cygwin to the Windows PATH.

11. There are many online guides that describe what the PATH is and how to add stuff to it, so I will not describe it here.
    Additionally, the process varies slightly across different versions of Windows, but it is always fairly simple.
    In my case, my root installation directory was C:\cygwin64, so I added C:\cygwin64\bin to my PATH. For the general case,
    add C:\root_installation_directory_path\bin to your Windows PATH.

12. Now, all you have to do is navigate to 3D-Representation/ directory and run `make` or `make -f makefile`. From there,
    see wiki on Using The Voxelizer with Linux.
