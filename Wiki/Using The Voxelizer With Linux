Welcome to the 3D-Representation wiki!

The Voxelizer will need a mol file representing the first molecule to be added
to the Active-Site. Once the first molecule (or atom) has been voxelized, we
can then add to our voxelized representation of the Active-Site by adding
molecules (or atoms) to the molecule.json file that is used to represent the
Active-Site. We can also separately voxelize the virus and the drug molecule
and then add the 2 voxelized representations together.

Everything at this moment uses 0 bonds and it would be very tough to actually
determine which atoms are connected to recognize the actual molecules.

Note - All commands to be run within the 3d-representation folder.

## Creating A New Voxelized Molecule Space (without bonds):

In this case we need a mol file representing the molecule to be voxelized
and then to decide the cubic voxel dimensions.For example, if we chose
dimensions = 0.5, then each individual voxel will be
(L = 0.5 x W = 0.5 x H = 0.5) in volume.

Run:
  - ./Voxelizer file dimensions

and in 3d-representation/ you will find a new file, molecule.json, which is the
voxelized spacial representation of the molecule that has been provided.
