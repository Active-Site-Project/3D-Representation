Welcome to the 3D-Representation wiki!

The Voxelizer will need a mol file representing the first molecule to be added
to the Active-Site. Once the first molecule (or atom) has been voxelized, we
can then add to our voxelized representation of the Active-Site by adding
molecules (or atoms) to the molecule.json file that is used to represent the
Active-Site. We can also separately voxelize the virus and the drug molecule
and then add the 2 voxelized representations together.

Everything at this moment uses 0 bonds and it would be very tough to actually
determine which atoms are connected to recognize the actual molecules.
