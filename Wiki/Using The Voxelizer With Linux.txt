Welcome to the 3D-Representation wiki!

The Voxelizer will need a mol file representing the first molecule to be added
to the Active-Site. Once the first molecule (or atom) has been voxelized, we
can then add to our voxelized representation of the Active-Site by adding
molecules (or atoms) to the molecule.json file that is used to represent the
Active-Site. We can also separately voxelize the virus and the drug molecule
and then add the 2 voxelized representations together.

Everything at this moment uses 0 bonds and it would be very tough to actually
determine which atoms are connected to recognize the actual molecules.

Note - All commands to be run within the 3d-representation folder.

## Creating A New Voxelized Molecule Space (without bonds):

In this case we need a mol file representing the molecule to be voxelized
and then to decide the cubic voxel dimensions.For example, if we chose
dimensions = 0.5, then each individual voxel will be
(L = 0.5 x W = 0.5 x H = 0.5) in volume.

Run:
  - ./Voxelizer molFile dimensions

and in 3d-representation/ you will find a new file, molecule.json, which is the
voxelized spacial representation of the molecule that has been provided.

Note - Bonds are not implemented at the moment.

## Adding A New Molecule To A Voxelized Molecule Space (without bonds):

In this case we need a Voxelized Molecule Space, yours will likely be
molecule.json, and then a mol file representing the molecule to be added to the
voxelized molecule space being provided.

The cubic voxel dimensions will be the same as those in the voxelized molecule
space provided.

Run:
  - ./Voxelizer voxelizedSpace.json molFile

and in 3d-representation/ you will find a new file, molecule.json, which is the
voxelized spacial representation of the provided voxelized molecule combined
with the molecule that was to be added to the provided voxelized molecule.

Note - Bonds are not implemented at the moment.

## Combining 2 Voxelized Molecule Spaces (without bonds):

  * To be implemented
