Welcome to the ElectronCloudGenerator wiki!

The Electron Cloud Generator will need the following inputs: (1)electron cloud radius.
(2)the number of electrons you would like in the cloud. (3)The name you would like to save 
the file under (do not include .txt extension as it will be added automatically).
The file once compiled will save in the ElectronClouds folder as a .txt file.

#Creating A New Electron Cloud File 

Run:
	- ./ElectronCloudGenerator radius electronCount fileName
	

Notes - 
radius = the atomic radius of the element in Angstrums
electronCount = the number of points you would like to generate in the cloud
fileName = the name you would like to save your file as in the ElectronClouds folder
	

In ElectronClouds/ folder you will now find your new .txt file containing the x, y, z
coordinates of each electron in the cloud. This file is now ready to be used in the
Voxelizer.
