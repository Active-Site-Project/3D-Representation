Electron Generator Wiki

User inputs: Van Der Waals Radius to the nearest tenth Angstrom, Element symbol.
Output: Text file full of electron x,y,z coordinates. File will be saved in
        ElectronClouds folder named ElementSymbol.txt


Purpose:
  Creates a file containing a list of electrons evenly distributed
  around a center point with a decaying electron density as the radius extends.
  These files are used by the voxilizer to generate a electron cloud for each
  atom in the ligand and the active site. We implemented our electron
  representation in this manor in hopes to capture the ways electron clouds
  overlap and avoid issues we see in function based electron density calculations.


How to use:
  In command line run:
    Python3 EG_2.0.py arg1 arg2

    replace arg 1 with the Van Der Waals radius in Angstroms to nearest tenth.
    replace arg 2 with the element name or desired file name.

  Once command has completed, navigate to the ElectronClouds folder to find the 
  newly created .txt file.
