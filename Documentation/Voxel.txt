This is the documentation page for Voxel.h. It will mostly be centered around
the Voxel class, however; this is where you will find everything related to the
Voxel.h.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Private Member Variables:

  - uint64_t protons: Used to keep track of the number of protons in a
                      particular Voxel. Later we plan to associate RGB values
                      towards the unity implementation side.

  - uint64_t neutrons:  Used to keep track of the number of neutrons in a
                        particular Voxel. Later we plan to associate RGB values
                        towards the unity implementation side.

  - uint64_t electrons: Used to keep track of the number of electrons in a
                        particular Voxel. Later we plan to associate RGB values
                        towards the unity implementation side.

## Public Member Functions:

  - Voxel():  Default Constructor. Sets private member variables protons,
              neutrons and electrons to 0.

  - Voxel(const Voxel&):  Copy Constructor. Sets private member variables
                          protons, neutrons and electrons to the corresponding
                          values of the Voxel provided.

  - uint64_t getProtons():  Returns the number of protons in the Voxel.

  - uint64_t getNeutrons(): Retuns the number of neutrons in the Voxel.

  - uint64_t getElectrons():  Returns the number of electrons in the Voxel.

  - void addProton(): Increments the value of private member variable
                      uint64_t protons by 1.

  - void addNeutron():  Increments the value of private member variable
                        uint64_t neutrons by 1.

  - void addElectron(): Increments the value of private member variable
                        uint64_t electrons by 1.

  - void addProtons(uint64_t):  Increments the value of private member variable
                                uint64_t protons by some number.

  - void addNeutrons(uint64_t): Increments the value of private member variable
                                uint64_t neutrons by some number.

  - void addElectrons(uint64_t):  Increments the value of private member variable
                                  uint64_t electrons by some number.
