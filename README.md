# Active-Site
Models an Active site of a molecule in 3 dimensional space.

How To Install:

1) Choose some directory for the application to be stored. (e.g. c:/my/path or ~/my/path)

2) If you have git installed then you can type git clone https://github.com/Active-Site-Project/3D-Representation.git from inside
    the directory that you you would like the project to be installed in. If you do not have git installed, you can download the
    repostitory zip file and extract it to the directory that you would like the project to be stored in.

3) Navigate to 3D-Representation/ directory and type the command make. You can now either run Voxelizer.exe with command line 
    arguments, or you can run Voxelizer.exe and it will prompt you for the molfile and your desired voxel size. (See documentation 
    on Voxelizer.exe below.)
